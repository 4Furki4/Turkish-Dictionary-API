# Turkish Dictionary API

- It's my very first API application built by Elysia powered by Bun to experience Bun for the first time!
- Since Bun applications are not ready to deploy, I cannot deploy my Turkish Dictionary API easily.

# Elysia with Bun runtime

## Getting Started
To get started with this template, simply paste this command into your terminal:
```bash
bun create elysia ./elysia-example
```

## Development
To start the development server run:
```bash

Open http://localhost:3000/ with your browser to see the result.
